Learning the intricacies of the Git commit history

`data.txt` [has an oops in it](https://github.com/jfredrickson5/history-sandbox/commit/5ccbe8df2aa512c094c51ab464c94b42f8922096#diff-70f5b20d30a0cea2b1b573401b61bcfc).

`data2.txt` [also has one, this time in a PR](https://github.com/jfredrickson5/history-sandbox/pull/1)

The repo has been cloned to multiple developer machines. Can we undo the oops everywhere?
